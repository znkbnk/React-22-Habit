Step 1: Create a New Components

- In your React project, create a new component
files for your skewed navbar,
e.g., SkewedNavbar.js,Sidebar.css
- Define the necessary code and styles for your 
skewed navbar in SkewedNavbar.js and Sidebar.css.
You can copy and paste the CSS code provided by 
https://github.com/AndiiCodes/front-end/tree/master/react/Skewed-navbar
into these files.

Step 2: Define Props in SkewedNavbar.js

- Inside SkewedNavbar.js, import the necessary file,
libraries and components, including useState if
you haven't already.
- Define your functional component, e.g., SkewedNavbar,
and specify the props it will receive. In your case,
these props are: onDeleteClick, onFavoriteClick,
onCompletedClick, onCategoriesClick, onThemeClick,
and onRegisterClick.

Step 3: Use State Hooks

- Inside SkewedNavbar.js, use the useState hook to 
manage the states you need. For example, you might
have states like showDeletedHabits, showFavoriteHabits,
showCompletedHabits, showCategoriesDropdown, theme,
and isRegistrationVisible.

Step 4: Create Event Handlers

- Define event handler functions for each of your props.
For instance, you can create functions like
handleDeleteClick, handleFavoriteClick, and so on.
- In each event handler, update the corresponding 
state using the useState setter function.

Step 5: Import and Use in App.js

- In your App.js file, import the SkewedNavbar 
component at the top of the file.
- In your return statement within the App component,
include the SkewedNavbar component. Pass the required 
props to it, such as onDeleteClick, onFavoriteClick, 
and so on, with appropriate functions to 
handle these props.
